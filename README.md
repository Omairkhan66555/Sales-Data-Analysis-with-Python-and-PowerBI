# Sales Data Analysis using Python and Power BI

This project demonstrates an end-to-end sales data analysis using Python for data preprocessing and RFM analysis, and Power BI for interactive visualizations.

 Overview

The goal of this project is to understand customer behavior, identify valuable customer segments, and uncover sales trends. The analysis involves:
- Cleaning and exploring sales data using Python (Pandas and Matplotlib)
- Performing RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation
- Creating a dashboard in Power BI to visualize key insights

## Key Insights

- Identified high-value customers using RFM metrics
- Analyzed monthly sales trends and top-performing customers
- Segmented customers for potential marketing strategies
- Built a dynamic Power BI dashboard to present all insights visually

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)
- Power BI
- CSV Files

## Files Included

- `Sales_Data.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning, EDA, and RFM analysis
- `sales_data_sample.csv`: Raw dataset used for analysis
- `rfm_segment_output.csv`: Final output with RFM segments
- `dashboard_screenshot.png`: Preview of Power BI Dashboard
- `README.md`: Project documentation
